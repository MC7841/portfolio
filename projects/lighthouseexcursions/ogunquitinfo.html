                <p>Originally Ogunquit was a small fishing village known as Fish Cove back in the late 1800s. The town 
                    was unprotected from the harsh Atlantic Storms and had to haul their boats inland each night. The people formed 
                    an association to dig a channel to connect Fish Cove with the Josias River. When the channel was complete, they 
                    had connected the town to the mainland with a bridge. This connection led to artists traveling to live in the 
                    village. Their influence transformed the town into a popular art colony and tourist destination.</p>
